      <p>Hi Bebiiii!!</p>
      <p>
        Happy New Year! It’s 2026 now and I still can’t believe how time flew by
        so fast, especially in the second half of 2025. It was just in June when
        I met you in Pampanga, and in a snap, you are my bebiii darling wifey
        good girl cutipie now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that short span, we’ve been through a lot of things: the fun, the not
        so fun, and everything in between. In all honesty, writing this letter
        has been difficult. There are no words that came to mind when I
        started—not because I have no feelings, but the opposite. I was simply
        overwhelmed by all the emotions, memories, and feelings we’ve been
        through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, a part of these moments are the fights and disagreements we had.
        It may not be pleasant to go through it, but I see it as a way of
        getting to know you better. In those unpleasantries, I have noticed a
        very small detail—one that makes me want to hug you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I vividly remember the time when we were silent because of a
        disagreement. I saw you quietly cleaning my shoes as if you’re not angry
        at all. I felt really touched by that gesture and to me it felt like
        love in its purest form. In fact, I am tearing up writing this part.
        Words cannot express how much I wanted to thank you and how much I
        appreciate that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you know, I tend to overthink a lot—especially during our quarrels. I
        think about how you don’t have an obligation to me, that you can just
        leave me anytime—but you never left. There was even this one fight where
        I saw you pick your clothes from our laundry basket. I thought you were
        gonna leave at first but then I saw you pick an underwear of mine.
        You’re just about to wash our clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These little moments, Bebi, are treasures I keep close to my heart. You
        may not know it, but even in the most random moments of our love story,
        I deeply love you. When you’re asking for softdrinks when youre not
        supposed to, I love you. When you laugh with that weirdly pitched tone,
        I love you. When you use my clothes to wipe your hands clean, I love
        you. When you sleep on your side and you block all the air from the fan,
        I still love you. When you say no to my requests, I still love you. In
        moments where you’re the most vulnerable, I love you even more. In my
        not so accurate recollection of a quote from a reel I watched, “To like
        because and to love despite”, know that I like you for a million reasons
        and love you despite all.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our first month, I remember you asking what are my intentions with
        you, and to that I answered I want to get to know you. This new year, I
        want to do the same—explore our dynamics, know and understand you more,
        find love in the little things, and witness how we grow as
        professionals, as individuals, as lovers and more. Sure enough, fights
        and disagreements are likely to happen still, and I cannot promise that
        I can avoid them all. What I can promise is that despite all these dark
        feelings and emotions, my love for you will top it all off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you. You are very important to me. I know I said those a million
        times already but let me say it again for I believe time is short. A few
        months have already passed, and I don’t want to find myself sitting on a
        porch with you one day with gray hair feeling like I have not said those
        phrases enough.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Your Everloving Bebi</p>
